# MealBuddy – AI-Powered Meal Planning App

An AI health planning app that helps you track ingredients, get personalized recipe suggestions, and monitor your nutrition.

---

## Overview

MealBuddy is a personalized mobile application that suggests recipes and meal ideas based on the ingredients you have on hand. By tracking your past meal choices, dietary preferences, and fridge inventory, MealBuddy continually refines its recommendations to promote healthier eating habits, reduce food waste, and save you money. It simplifies meal prep with AI-driven meal plans tailored to your schedule and nutrition goals.

## Inspiration

Over one-third of U.S. consumers (38%) frequently don't know what to make at mealtimes—10% "very often" and 28% "frequently." This uncertainty often leads to nutritional imbalances, excessive food waste, and the frustration of juggling complex schedules and dietary needs, especially for busy families and younger adults. MealBuddy was born to tackle these pain points by delivering instant, inventory-based meal suggestions that fit real-world routines and individual preferences.
